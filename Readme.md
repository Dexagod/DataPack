# RDF-Package
This library enables the packaging of RDF graphs with provenance, usage control, signature and other custom RDF metadata.

## Installation

Please make sure you are using Node v20 or higher for this. Lower versions will give issues with the `crypto` module.

yarn add github:SolidLabResearch/RDF-Package --ignore-engines
